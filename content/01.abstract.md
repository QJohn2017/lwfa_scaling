## Abstract {.page_break_before}

We apply analytical scaling laws to the parameters of the CETAL laser system,
in order to estimate the maximum obtainable electron energy and total charge in
a laser-wakefield acceleration scenario. We also roughly predict the expected
betatron radiation spectrum, emitted by the accelerated electrons. Finally, we
apply the same analysis to the case of the envisioned GBS parameters.
